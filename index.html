<p>For Coffee Club, coffee is the call of home.
  In our differing journeys to Canada from Mexico, and the specialty roasting business that has become our second home, coffee returns us each and every day to the embrace of family.
  <br>
  <br>
  From splashing and thrashing in the pool-like tanks where coffee cherries go to ferment - and children to cool off - to the shrieks and squeals hide-and-seek unleashed among the burlap sacks stored in the barn on our grandparent&apos;s farm in Mexico&apos;s Pluma Hidalgo; coffee is the lap of childhood we never expected to find in Canada. We came here to study: subjects nothing to do with coffee, although we drank it as students do.
  <br>

  <br>
  A chance meeting, and a position as inventory manager at a Toronto coffee enterprise for one of us, led us both to where we are now when that business, Green Beanery, closed and we took over the Beanery&apos;s beans and roasting operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was here that we discovered that Mexico isn&apos;t the sole source of all things coffee (which we really thought it was). It turns out that coffee beans are grown all over the world and are as diverse in taste and personality as the world itself. That revelation continues to inspire our journey as Coffee Club.</p>
